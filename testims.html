<p>&#8220;My father is 88 years old, and had become more and more isolated socially due to hearing loss &#8211; mostly high-frequency. He has been using hearing aids prescribed and adjusted by a medical specialist for the past several years, with very limited success.  Even with the hearing aid, others have had to speak loudly close to his &#8220;better&#8221; ear, often with several repeats. I  just quickly tried out your BioAid app on an iPod Touch with him, with only about 5 minutes work guessing at a setting &#8211; gradual high-frequency boost (your &#8220;B&#8221; default) with the noise suppression cranked up a bit.</p>
<p>The effect for him (and for my mother) was dramatic.  For the first time in several years, in either a home environment, or driving in the car, they could now carry on a regular conversation in normal voice, even when sitting about 10 feet apart, instead of her nearly shouting into his ear with very imperfect results. It works well for him also in a small group, such as a (somewhat quieter) restaurant environment with friends &#8212; he can follow and participate in the <strong>group</strong> discussion, which he has also been unable to do any more.&quot; &#8211; <em>Anon</em></p>

<p>&#8220;I was amazed, took a chance and could not be more pleased .. Don&#8217;t have hearing aides yet and this app has made such a difference. Very pleased .. Would definitely pay for this .. thanks for the free app  Great&#8221; &#8211; <em>Me2533</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Having tested a few other apps, this one surpasses the rest. It provides a simple user friendly way of selecting the frequencies you need amplifying, other hearing aids just make everything louder which makes them uncomfortable most of the time. This allowed me to select the best frequency, and picks out the detail in the sound that is usually hard to hear for me, I plugged in my hands free kit with earphones and mike in the cord, and it just looks like I&#8217;m wearing earphones, brilliant!!&#8221; &#8211; <em>FraggerBlagger</em></p>

<p>&#8220;I am amazed with this app. I have two <span class="caps">CIC</span> hearing aid worth more than 2500 pounds and this one beats the pants off. 5 stars without a doubt. Its a great substitute or even better than the hearing aids sold in market for thousands of pounds!!!!!! Keep up the good work.&#8221; &#8211; <em>MG</em><br />

<p>&#8220;What distinguishes BioAid from the competition is the availability within the app of multiple settings to meet the needs of different types of hearing loss. You can have a flat boost of all frequencies or you can choose to boost just high frequencies, in a variety of ways, using different amounts of compression, and you can even adjust the sensitivity to background noise. In a sense, you have the kind of control over frequency curves that usually only an audiologist would. It works.  Versatile Hearing Amplification&#8221; &#8211; <em>Bob in Brooklyn</em></p>

<p>&#8220;We just used the app with a set of over ear headphones with my mother-in-law. She kept her hearing aids in and the headphones didn&#8217;t even buzz. Once we started the app and started talking her face lit up in excitement! She could hear better and more clearly. It&#8217;s not practical for being out in public but she was hearing full conversations at the dinner table even with a washer and drier in the back ground. Typically she would barely hear her name even with her hearing aids all the way up. This app is great if used like this!!!  Amazing!&#8221; &#8211; <em>NTJJake</em></p>
